# MSOffice365-KMS Activated
This repository allows you to download MS Office 365 based on the Deployment Tool for Office 365 tool by Microsoft but with a twist. It includes a KMS activation to get MS Office 365 for free.

It also has a configuration file that allows you to install different MSOffice versions, architectures, and language and exclude some parts of MSOffice programs like Outlook, Groove Music, Lynx, etc.

# How to use
1. To install MS Office 365, simply grab the repo and run the "Run me to install. cmd" script with administrator rights.
Don't forget to update the configuration file if you wish to install it in a different language or on different system architecture, for example. 


# KMS Activation
1. Open kms.txt and paste each line one by one.

# Configuration
You can customize the contents of the file "config.xml" to your liking. 
The XML file has comments to aid you through the customizing process.
