# MSOffice365-KMS Activated
This repository allows you do download MSOffice 365 based on the Deployment Tool for Office 365 tool by Microsoft but with a twist. It includes a KMS activation to get MSOffice 365 for free.

It also has a configuration file which allows you to install different MSOffice versions, architectures and language. 

By editing the configuration file you can also exclude some part of MSOffice programs like Outlook, Groove Music, Lynx etc.

# How to use
1. Just download the repository and run the "Run me to install.cmd" with admin privilege to install MSOffice 365. Don't forget to edit the config file if you want to install it on different language or machine architecture etc.

# KMS Activation
1. Open kms.txt and paste each line one by one.

# Configuration
You can edit the contents of the file "config.xml" according to your own preference. Comments are already included on the XML file to guide you on the customization.
